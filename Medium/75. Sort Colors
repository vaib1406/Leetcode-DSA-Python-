Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        l =0
        curr = 0
        r =len(nums)-1

        while curr <= r:
            if nums[curr] == 0:
                nums[l], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[l]
                l+=1
                curr+=1
            elif nums[curr] == 2:
                nums[curr], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[curr]
                r-=1
            else:
                curr+=1

        return nums
