Given a character array s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem in-place, i.e. without allocating extra space.



class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s.reverse()

        start = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == " ":
                s[start:i] = s[start:i][::-1]
                start = i + 1

        s[start:] = s[start:][::-1]
