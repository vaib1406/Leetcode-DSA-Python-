Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
     c = Counter(nums)
     for n in c:
         if c[n] == 1:
             return n
