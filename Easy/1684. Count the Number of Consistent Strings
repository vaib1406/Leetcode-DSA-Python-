You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

 
 
 class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for w in range(len(words)):
            if sorted(set(list(words[w] + allowed))) == list(sorted(allowed)):
                count = count + 1
        return count
