You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.

Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.


class Solution:
    def prefixCount(self, words: List[str], pref: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for w in words:
            if pref == w[:len(pref)]:
                 count = count +1
        return count
