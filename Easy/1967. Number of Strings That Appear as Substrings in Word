Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 
 
 class Solution:
    def numOfStrings(self, patterns: List[str], word: str) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        for p in range(len(patterns)):
            if patterns[p] in word:
                  cnt = cnt +1
        return cnt
