Given a string s, return true if s is a good string, or false otherwise.

A string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

 
 
 from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def areOccurrencesEqual(self, s: str) -> bool:
        st = Counter(s)
        return len(list(set(list(st.values())))) == 1
