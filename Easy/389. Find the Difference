You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 
 
 class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        res = 0
        re = 0
        for str in s:
            res = res + ord(str)
        for tr in t:
            re = re + ord(tr)

        return (chr(re-res))
