Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.


class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        ele = set()
        while(n!=1):
            sumOfSquare = 0 
            for i in str(n):
                sumOfSquare =+ sumOfSquare + int(i) ** 2
            n = sumOfSquare
            if n in ele:
                return False
            else:
                ele.add(n)
        return True
