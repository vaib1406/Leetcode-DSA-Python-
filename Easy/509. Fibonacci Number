The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        a=0
        b=1
        count = 0
        li = []

        while(count < n+1):
            c = a+b
            print(li.append(c))    
            a=b
            b=c
            count = count + 1
        return li
