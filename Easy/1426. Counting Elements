Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.


class Solution:
    def countElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for a in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[a]+ 1 in arr:
                count+=1
        return count
