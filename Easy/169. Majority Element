Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.



class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import Counter
        n = (len(nums))//2
        
        a = Counter(nums)
        for c,d in a.items():
            if d > n:
                return c
